# Royce Data Handbook

This is a collection of guides, tutorials, and bits of information for the Royce Institute Data Infrastructure Project, we have written an extensive tutorial on how you can contribute which can be found [here](https://data-curators-royce-institute.github.io/royce-data-handbook/team_tutorials/work-on-this-book.html).

## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the Royce Data Handbook book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
   - Or `conda env create --file env.yaml`
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `handbook/` directory
4. (Optional) Run `jupyter-book clean handbook/` to remove any existing builds (Not recommended unless you are prepared to transfer files from `handbook` to `handbook/_build` in the hierarchical structure of this repository)
5. Run `jupyter-book build handbook/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `handbook/_build/html/` in your local directory.  
You can view the fully rendered HTML version locally by opening `index.html` located in `handbook/_build/html/` in your web browser.
