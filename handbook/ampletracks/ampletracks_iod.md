# Ampletracks instance-on-demand

We try to make Ampletracks as easy to test as possible for interested parties, so we provide a limited time period test site for you to use and explore Ampletracks. The site will be instantiated with record types and records from and example set up on <https://demo.ampletracks.com>. The example is based on one of our tutorials, which can be found on the [extended Ampletracks user tutorial](./ampletracks_demo_extended.md).

Your test site will be available for you to use for up to 1 week from instantiation, after which it will be deleted. We do not store anything you configure on your test version.

```{warning}
Since the test website you will be setting up will be destroyed within a week of instantiating, please take care to not input any important details you cannot retrieve.
```
