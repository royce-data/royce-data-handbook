# Version Control with Git Workshop

We largely follow the Carpentries curricula for our workshops.

Currently the Henry Royce Institute is not an affiliate member of the Carpentries, as is such our lessons are not branded Carpentry workshops. However, we do use the lessons from the Carpentries for our workshops, as they are licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) License.

## Intro to UNIX Shell and Intro to Git

For our one-day introduction to the UNIX Shell and Introduction to Git workshops we follow [The UNIX Shell Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) Lessons 1 - 3 and the [Version Control with Git Software Carpentry](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/index.html) Lessons 1 - 13, with our own lessons in using the Git GUI and the GitHub GUI.
