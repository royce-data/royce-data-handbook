## Version control in research data management

Version control is an important practice in managing your files and keeping everything tidy. We might think of version control as something reserved for people who write "real" software but that is far from its only application.  

Certain applications you might use as part of your research already have version control built-in. some of these are, Overleaf for rendering <span class="latex">L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X</span>, and Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint, when combined with OneDrive.


By adopting version control as a practice we can produce tidier documents and code, without lines and lines of commented out code taking up space.
