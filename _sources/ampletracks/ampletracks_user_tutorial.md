# Ampletracks *User* Tutorials

We will be using <https://demo.ampletracks.com> for this tutorial.

In this *User* tutorial we will be creating a record for an **ingot of Steel** received from **Company A**. We want to perform EBSD on the sample so need to section it to smaller pieces. We will be using a **Tescan LC FEG-SEM** to perform EBSD. We will be **storing** the EBSD maps on an area of our **local drive**. We want a way to track this procedure and decide to use Ampletracks to index the samples and EBSD maps, and relate them to each other and the acquisition equipment.

We will:

1. Create a *Sample* record for the ingot
2. Create a '*Sub-Sample*' record from our original *Sample* record (or *Child* Sample, as is referred to in Ampletracks) for our sectioned steel ingot
3. Create a *Dataset* record to index the EBSD map data, which is stored in a local drive
4. Edit these records to relate them to each other

   The *Record* <i class="fa-sharp fa-solid fa-arrow-right"></i> *Child Record* relationship is intrinsic and does not require any manual input from the *User* other than the creation of the *Child Record*
