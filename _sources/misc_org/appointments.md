   :::{note}
   You can find out about the team and our personal contact information on this [page](https://www.royce.ac.uk/data-curation/)
   :::
2. Book us during our clinic hours using our online booking form below [<i class="bi bi-arrow-down-square-fill"></i>](#calendly-link)
   :::{attention}
   Our clinic hours are 3 hours during the week where we have open **bookable** 30 minute time slots. You can choose the time window and location, and let us know what you would like to consult us on using the booking form. If you would like more time then try to book a subsequent slot, or include a note in your booking.
