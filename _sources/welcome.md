# Welcome

Welcome to the Henry Royce Institute Data Management Handbook.
We've written this to share resources that we find useful to (research) data management practices, and to host our user guides.  
<br>
The content is written and managed by the {{ data_curators }} of the {{ royce_institute }}, based at the Royce Hub Building, the University of Manchester.  
<br>
We're proudly powered by {{ jupyter_book }} and {{ executable_books }}.  
<br>
This book isn't meant to be read page-to-page or in the sequence presented in the sidebar.  
We suggest starting out with a topic from the sidebar that interests you.  
<br>
Some of the most useful materials will be found under the **Research Data Management** section and the **[Utilities](util/useful-interesting.md)** article.  
<br>
:::{note}
Some of the content in this book are training materials for our team, so while not directly relevant they might be useful to some, or if you're interested in contributing.
